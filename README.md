C# project.

The application is implemented on: 
1)WPF MVVM.

The following algorithms are implemented for the calculator:
1)The Algorithm of Reverse Polish Notation.

In the converters of measured values, the conversion takes place by bringing the source elements to the reference element of the selected measurement system.
Unit testing is implemented on the NUnit framework.
Error logging is implemented on the NLog framework.

Coming soon:

1)Implementation of a number converter from different computing systems.
2)Visualization of function graphs.
3)Application visualization for ASP MVÐ¡.
